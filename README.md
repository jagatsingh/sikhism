## Gurmat camp

Gurmat and summer camps for kids are major events which help to bring kids closer to 
our roots. Living in western world makes it a bigger challenge.

We plan regular activities to keep kids focused and the camp folder is having 
stuff related to activities related to kids

It can be regular weekend events of longer ones depending on vacation of the kids

## Presentations

On occasion of Gurupurab we made presentations to be shared with sangat. So they 
have been saved in presentations folder.
